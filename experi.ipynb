For MBA programme kindly refer to Annexure-V.   11.7.1 Award of MSR degree with PhD degree to those students who are admitted to PhD program in Engineering directly after a B.Tech./BS(4Yr)/M.Sc. degree or have converted from MSR degree to PhD degree:   All students who are pursuing the PhD degree directly after B.Tech./BS(4Yr)/M.Sc. degree can opt to get the additional MSR degree awarded along with the PhD degree at the time of graduation. This is subject to the following conditions: 1. The minimum total credit requirement will be 216 (the same as for PhD after B. Tech/BS/M. Sc). 2. The minimum number of thesis credits will be the sum of minimum number of thesis credits of MSR (72) and PhD (72), equalling 144. 3. The minimum number of course credits should be the maximum of C1 and C2, where C1 is the course credits required for MSR and C2 is the course credits required for PhD after B.Tech/BS/M.Sc. This number varies between 36 and 90 depending on the department. 4. Only MSR thesis option will be available to the student and the problem which forms the major content of the MSR thesis should be different from the one reported in the PhD thesis. To ensure this, there should be plagiarism check performed between the MSR and the PhD thesis. Also, it is recommended that at least one member of the thesis oral boards should be common across the two boards. 5. Student can deliver open seminar after MSR defense without waiting for six months.   12. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS  A student shall be deemed to have completed the graduation requirements., if the student has  i) passed all the prescribed courses,  ii)  attained the minimum required CPI,  iii)  satisfied the minimum academic and duration requirements,.  iv)  satisfied all the requirements specified by the concerned department, if any,  v)  satisfied all the requirements specified by the Senate and the Ordinances..

Similarly, the CPI indicates the cumulative academic performance in all the courses taken including those taken in the current semester.  7.7. Academic Performance Requirement ( Refer to Addendum  for existing clause for Y23 and later batch students ) 7.7.1. The minimum CPI requirement for continuing in the programme or for graduation is given below.  D.IIT./M.Tech./M.Des./M.S. by Research/MBA programme :  6.5. Ph.D. programme :       7.0.  7.7.2. In the first semester in which the student registers, the minimum CPI (SPI) may be relaxed to 6.0  and the student may be allowed to continue in the following semester on the recommendations of the DPGC and with the approval of the SPGC. A letter of warning will be issued by the Head of the Department/IDP of the student.  7.7.3. In subsequent semesters, if a D.IIT. /M.Tech./M.Des./M.S. by Research/MBA student secures a CPI between 6.0 and 6.5 or a Ph.D. student secures a CPI between 6.5 and 7.0, he/she may be allowed to continue in the following semester on the recommendation of the DPGC and with the approval of the SPGC.

       "   '(24) 7.6.8. Computation of the Semester Performance Index (SPI) and Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)  The SPI is an indicator of the overall academic performance of a student in all the courses he/she has registered during a given semester. It is computed as follows: If the grades awarded to a student are G 1, G2 etc in courses with corresponding credits C 1, C2 etc, the SPI is given by   SPI = (C 1G1 + C2 G2 + …) / (C 1 + C2 + …)   In the above computation, courses with S and X grades are ignored. Similarly, the CPI indicates the cumulative academic performance in all the courses taken including those taken in the current semester.  7.7. Academic Performance Requirement ( Refer to Addendum  for existing clause for Y23 and later batch students ) 7.7.1. The minimum CPI requirement for continuing in the programme or for graduation is given below.  D.IIT./M.Tech./M.Des./M.S. by Research/MBA programme :  6.5. Ph.D. programme :       7.0.  7.7.2. In the first semester in which the student registers, the minimum CPI (SPI) may be relaxed to 6.0  and the student may be allowed to continue in the following semester on the recommendations of the DPGC and with the approval of the SPGC. A letter of warning will be issued by the Head of the Department/IDP of the student.  7.7.3. In subsequent semesters, if a D.IIT. /M.Tech./M.Des./M.S. by Research/MBA student secures a CPI between 6.0 and 6.5 or a Ph.D. student secures a CPI between 6.5 and 7.0, he/she may be allowed to continue in the following semester on the recommendation of the DPGC and with the approval of the SPGC. A letter of warning will be issued by the Head of the Department/IDP of the student. 7.7.4. A student will normally not be allowed to continue in the D.IIT./M.Tech./ M.Des./M.S. by Research /MBA programme if  i) his/her CPI is below 6.0  ii) his/her CPI is below 6.5 in two consecutive semesters (however, SPGC may consider continuation as per provisions of 7.7.3). iii) he/she obtains two Fs or two Es or one F and one E in the same or different courses. iv) he/she accumulates three or more Xs towards thesis grades.   7.7.5. A student will normally not be allowed to continue in the Ph.D. programme if  i) his/her CPI is below 6.5  ii) his/her CPI is below 7.0 in two consecutive semesters (however, SPGC may consider continuation as per provisions of 7.7.3).  iii) he/she obtains two Fs or two Es or one F and one E in the same or different courses.  iv) he/she accumulates eight or more Xs towards thesis grades. v) he/she accumulates six or more Xs towards thesis grades in two consecutive semesters. vi) he/she secures Xs in all the thesis credits registered for in two consecutive semesters.  7.7.6.
